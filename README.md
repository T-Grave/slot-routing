# Remix Slot Routing!

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Problems

- [] We will need to patch the react-router production version as well if we want this to work correctly on production builds
- [x] Actions have not yet been tested (they seem to work out of the box)
- [] The remix router patch will never be merged as is in Remix, we will need to come up with a solution that could be merged in the long term
